/**
 * The game controller is present as a controller. It calls the different methods throughout the code.
 * This means that the class does all the functional work. It tells us which directions we can go, which command cards
 * we get.
 *
 *
 * The app controller is used primarily for estetics. Meaning we wouldn't have an actual picture on the screen.
 * So in the app controller we define which colors we use for the players and how we save/load/stop a game*/
